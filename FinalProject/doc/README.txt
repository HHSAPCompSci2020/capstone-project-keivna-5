Introduction: 


What does your program do?
* The user navigates a 3D life-like world to find the perfect photography shot. The user gets to explore the Golden Gate Bridge from any angle and take photos they could never do in person. The program opens up a 3D world boarded by a viewfinder, as if the user was looking directly into the camera. Once the user finds the perfect location by navigating through the 3D world, they can take a photo with the shutter button displayed on the viewfinder. They can advance their photography skills by changing ISO, shutter speed (for long-exposure photos), and the direction of the light source. The physical 3D environment will be in a continuous mode where cars will continuously pass by on the bridge, and various backgrounds can be selected. All shots will be visible in the portfolio and a glossary window is available to learn how to use various features. Overall, the user will be able to escape the real world and practice getting that perfect shot all from the comfort of their home.


What problem does it solve? Why did you write it?
* The purpose of this application is to create a place where people can explore and practice their photography skills without having to go anywhere. It offers a free alternative to buying expensive equipment as the 3D world focuses on learning and developing photography skills that can be later implemented in real life. This also includes teaching people about different photography techniques as well as helping people create their own virtual portfolios of the photos they took. 


What is the story?
* A young audience is interested in photography but doesn’t have the means to get a fancy camera and travel to various locations. However, this program is the perfect place to practice and fine-tune their photography skills for the day they get the opportunity to use a real camera. This makes photography accessible to all, no matter where they are. 


What are the rules? What is the goal?
* There are no rules to the application, as it is an open environment to practice photography. The goal is to get a good grasp of using the different camera features and photography concepts, navigating the environment using the world tab. Once a user is comfortable with the different features, they will be able to build up their portfolio, viewing them in the portfolio tab. 


Who would want to use your program?
* Anyone interested in developing their photography skills anywhere and anytime, without needing to pay for an expensive camera and travel to various locations. This could be a student (of any age) who is dipping their feet in photography, an amateur photographer, or someone who simply wants to view our world from an enhanced perspective and be able to change various aspects of this world.


What are the primary features of your program?
* The primary features are moving around the environment, adjusting different camera features, and taking photos that can be viewed in a portfolio. To move around the environment, the user would be positioned in front of the viewfinder and use the control keys to go to different locations in the environment. This method will be similar to the Google Maps Street View application.To adjust the camera features, like zoom, ISO, shutter speed etc., users would use the buttons on the edges of the frame. Finally, the photos that the user takes would be viewable through the portfolio tab, and a glossary tab will be available to explain all features.


Instructions:
Which keyboard keys will do what? 
* WASD keys to navigate the x and y axis in the 3D world
* Q/E keys to navigate the z axis in the 3D world
* up/down/left/right arrow keys to pan the view in the vertical and horizontal direction


Where will you need to click? 
* All buttons will be displayed on the viewfinder.
* Use the mouse to click the shutter, change tabs, take a long exposure photo, change the ISO, shutter speed, light source, and background.
* Click photos in the portfolio to expand it


Will you have menus that need to be navigated? What will they look like? 
* There will be three main viewing options that will take the form of a three tabs: Viewfinder World, Portfolio, and Glossary
* Viewfinder World: Main feature, move around in the 3D environment, change camera settings, and take photos that will be saved in the portfolio
* Portfolio: View all photos captured in a grid list view. Photos can be clicked on to expand them, and you can go back to the grid by clicking a back button
* Glossary: describes various camera features


Do actions need to be taken in a certain order?
* The user must position the viewfinder or camera to the desired location before hitting the shutter button to take their photo. They position themselves in the 3D world (specific x/y/z location) with the keyboard keys. All setting changes (ISO, shutter speed, light source) must be done before capturing a photo (long exposure or a simple shot).




Features List (THE ONLY SECTION THAT CANNOT CHANGE LATER):
Must-have Features:
[These are features that we agree you will definitely have by the project due date. A good final project would have all of these completed. At least 5 are required. Each feature should be fully described (at least a few full sentences for each)]
* Environment:
   * The environment will be a 3D environment based on the Golden Gate Bridge, similar to the images depicted below.
   * This 3D environment will include a red bridge with suspension lines, a simple water base that is basically a blue rectangle, and a light blue sky background.


   * 3D World Navigation: 
   * The user can move around in this 3D world to various angles using the control methods listed above, moving around the x, y and z axis, similar to the Google Maps 3D world function. 
   * The world navigation is to move around the position of the camera, while the zoom feature on the camera will change the view of the camera.


   * Capture a Photo: 
   * The 3D world is bordered by a viewfinder that includes a shutter button to take a photo and a dial for an extra zoom in/out.
   * The photo will then be saved in the user’s portfolio, along with the rest of the photos, with details like the title, time taken and what camera concepts were used in taking the photo.
   * A sample bridge placement looks like the following:
   *   

   * Sound Effects:
   * There will be a constant background sound effect of city cars and waves crashing.
   * A shutter sound will also take place whenever a photo is taken.


   * Portfolio: A separate 2D tab will be available in the window.
   * This portfolio contains all the images the user has taken (even when the window has been closed and reopened)
   * They will be displayed in a grid-like series of images


Want-to-have Features:
[These are features that you would like to have by the project due date, but you’re unsure whether you’ll hit all of them. A good final project would have perhaps half of these completed. At least 5 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
      * Manual Mode I (Change things)
      * This will be used to learn photography basics. User can change conceptual camera setting such as brightness
      * change brightness, ISO, aperture etc…


      * Manual Mode II (Add things)
      * The user may move people, cars, and trees around to predefined locations in the 3D world.
      * The user can add haze, clouds, rainbows, and lighting to the sky.


      * Expanded 3D Setting:
      * Simple hills on the side
      * Buildings from surrounding city (not super detailed)
      * More realistic water under the bridge
      * Adding more details to the bridge (ex: lights, the road, sidewalk


      * Expanded Portfolio: Not only will the portfolio contain all photos, but the user will be able to sort it into different categories/folders they can choose and name.


      * Glossary/info page: 
      * The glossary page will be a third tab (in addition to the 3D world and portfolio)
      * Similar to a more developed ReadMe, the glossary explains various features of the program as well as photography conceptual features.


      * Expand sound effects: 
      * There will be a constant mix of city and wave sounds blended into the background
      * As the user gets closer to the bridge or the nearby city on the mountains, the city sound effects increase
      * As the user gets farther away, the user will hear nature sounds such as water and birds.
      * Export files: The user can export the photos they took only their device


Stretch Features:
[These are features that we agree a fully complete version of this program would have, but that you probably will not have time to implement. A good final project does not necessarily need to have any of these completed at all. At least 3 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
      * Continuous Mode: The user lives in a 3D world where things are constantly moving around
      * For example as time passes: the sky gets darker, the sun sets, cars pass on the bridge, clouds shift, birds fly, and people walk and bike on the side of the bridge.


      * Expanded camera settings: Add the following to Manual Mode:l
      * Long exposure
      * Portrait


      * Videography: The user can take a video or video capture through the camera viewfinder.
      * First, the video will simply be without moving the perspective, the only type of action would be the continuous mode (if available).
      * Next, once we develop the first version, the user will be able to take a video while moving around the perspective on the 3 different axes.


      * Different settings: 
      * In addition to the Golden Gate Bridge, there will be various settings such as the Eiffel Tower or nature scenes such as a forest, beach, and waterfall. 




Class List:
[This section lists the Java classes that make up the program and very briefly describes what each represents. It’s totally fine to put this section in list format and not to use full sentences.]
